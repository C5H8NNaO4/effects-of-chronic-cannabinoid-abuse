## Preface

This article is **not** complete yet. This is just a draft and its completion will take some time.

Currently, this article contains only a collection of basic neurobiological knowledge. If you are interested in this topic, feel free to read the following sections. However, do not expect any conclusions.

The whole thing is kept very superficial. Gradually, information is being collected that links the following mentioned diseases to their respective neuropathological causes in order to get a general overview of the neurobiological functioning of withdrawal, the brain and  psychotropic drugs. 

### ADHD
ADHD often correlates with substance abuse. People who suffer from ADHD should be extra cautious when dealing with drugs.

**Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder** (**ADHD**) is a [mental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder "Mental disorder") of the [neurodevelopmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder "Neurodevelopmental disorder") type.<sup>[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-pmid23299717-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-Caroline2010-11)</sup> It is characterized by [difficulty paying attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattention "Inattention"), excessive activity, and [behavior without regards to consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity "Impulsivity") which is not [appropriate for a person's age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_appropriateness "Age appropriateness").<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-NIH2016-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-2) </sup>There are also often problems with regulation of emotions.<sup>[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-14)</sup>  In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-NIH2016-1)</sup> Additionally there is an association with other mental disorders and [**substance misuse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_misuse "Substance misuse").<sup>[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-16) </sup>Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as [hyperfocus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus "Hyperfocus")).<sup>[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-Koo2019-5)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-Wal2012-17)</sup>
>Wikipedia - [ADHD][wiki:ADHD]

>Research has shown that, in children with ADHD, the chemical messenger dopamine is transported differently between the nerve cells of the brain, especially in the regions that are used for memory and learning. [^adhd-dopamine]

> The 12-month prevalence of ADHD was 59.0 % (severe symptomatology: 33.1 %), high rates of comorbid disorders (92.9 % depression, 5.1 % bipolar disorder, 28.6 % anxiety disorder, 30.6 % emotional unstable (Borderline) personality disorder, 31.6 % avoidant personality disorder, 18.4 % dependent personality disorder, 25.5 % combined personality disorder, 10.2 % obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, 26.5 % PTSD, 25.5 % restless legs syndrome, 24.5 % adiposity, 11.2 % eating disorder, 45.9 % learning difficulty, 51.0 % nicotine dependency, 4.1 % alcohol dependency, 7.1 % illegal substance dependency), risk factors for ADHD, a high genetic risk (72.4 %) and problems in psychosocial functioning.[^adhd-prevalance]

### Effects
The effects of years of drug abuse are devastating and range from confusion, memory disorders, excessive sweating, depression, anxiety,  bipolarity and paranoia to panic attacks, dissociativity and schizoaffective disorders.

### Treatments
The good part of the story is, you can fix all of this. It's a long way to go; it won't be easy, but it's indeed very possible to get back on track.

# Metabolism
### THC, ADCY1, ATP, cAMP und die PKA Transkription

THC activates the CNR1, which inhibits [ADCY1][wiki:adcy1] in the synaptic cleft, leading to a reduction in ATP-cAMP transformation
>All classes of adenylyl cyclase [catalyse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis "Catalysis") the conversion of [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate") (ATP) to [3',5'-cyclic AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate") (cAMP) and [pyrophosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate "Pyrophosphate").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase#cite_note-:2-4)
>
This results in a chronic deficiency of the secondary messenger *cAMP*, and a reduction of *PKA* transcription, which is dependent on the *cAMP* concentration in the cell

> PKA is also commonly known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase {...] as protein expression varies from cell type to cell type, the proteins that are available for phosphorylation will depend upon the cell in which PKA is present. Thus, the effects of PKA activation vary.

and may lead to a dystonia of *PKA* [gene regulation][gene regulation] in the *Hippocampus*, *cerebellum* and *basal ganglia*. [Specifically affected][cannabinoid-pathway] are: PRKAR1A, PRKAR1B, PRKAR2A, PRKAR2B, PRKACA, PRKACB and PRKACG.

### THC and the dopamine system

> *In vivo* microdialysis shows that acute THC increases dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5123717/#R41), striatum [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5123717/#R42) and nucleus accumbens



# Basics
### ATP - Adenosintriphosphat
**Adenosine triphosphate**  (**ATP**) is a complex  [organic chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound")  that provides energy to drive many processes in living  [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)"), e.g. muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of  [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency")" of intracellular  [energy transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transfer "Energy transfer").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#cite_note-2)  When consumed in  [metabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism")  processes, it converts either to  [adenosine diphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate "Adenosine diphosphate")(ADP) or to  [adenosine monophosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate "Adenosine monophosphate")  (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#cite_note-3)  It is also a  [precursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry) "Precursor (chemistry)")  to DNA and RNA, and is used as a  [coenzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme "Coenzyme").

From the perspective of  [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry"), ATP is classified as a  [nucleoside triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_triphosphate "Nucleoside triphosphate"), which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base ([adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine "Adenine")), the sugar  [ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose "Ribose"), and the  [triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphosphate "Polyphosphate").

## First Messenger - Ligand
In  [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry")  and  [pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology "Pharmacology"), a  **ligand**  is a substance that forms a  [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(chemistry) "Complex (chemistry)")  with a  [biomolecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule "Biomolecule")  to serve a biological purpose. In protein-ligand binding, the ligand is usually a molecule which produces a signal by binding to a  [site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site "Binding site")  on a target  [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"). The binding typically results in a change of  [conformational isomerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformational_isomerism "Conformational isomerism")  (conformation) of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)#cite_note-1)  or protein[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)#cite_note-2)  which binds to the  [DNA double helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix "Nucleic acid double helix"). The relationship between ligand and binding partner is a function of charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure. The instance of binding occurs over an infinitesimal range of time and space, so the rate constant is usually a very small number.

Binding occurs by  [intermolecular forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force "Intermolecular force"), such as  [ionic bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond "Ionic bond"),  [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond")  and  [Van der Waals forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force "Van der Waals force"). The association of  [docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular) "Docking (molecular)")  is actually reversible through dissociation. Measurably irreversible  [covalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent "Covalent")  bonding between a ligand and target molecule is atypical in biological systems. In contrast to the definition of  [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand "Ligand")  in  [metalorganic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalorganic "Metalorganic")  and  [inorganic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_chemistry "Inorganic chemistry"), in biochemistry it is ambiguous whether the ligand generally binds at a  [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal")  site, as is the case in  [hemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin "Hemoglobin"). In general, the interpretation of ligand is contextual with regards to what sort of binding has been observed. The etymology stems from  _ligare_, which means 'to bind'.

Ligand binding to a  [receptor protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry) "Receptor (biochemistry)")  alters the conformation by affecting the three-dimensional shape orientation. The conformation of a receptor protein composes the functional state. Ligands include  [substrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry) "Substrate (biochemistry)"),  [inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor "Enzyme inhibitor"),  [activators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(proteomics) "Activator (proteomics)"), and  [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter"). The rate of binding is called  [affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand_binding_affinity), and this measurement typifies a tendency or strength of the effect. Binding affinity is actualized not only by  [host–guest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host%E2%80%93guest_chemistry "Host–guest chemistry")  interactions, but also by solvent effects that can play a dominant,  [steric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steric_effects "Steric effects")  role which drives  [non-covalent binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-covalent_interactions "Non-covalent interactions")  in solution.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)#cite_note-3)  The solvent provides a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt, and thus accept or reject each other as partners.

## Second Messenger
**Second messengers**  are intracellular signaling molecules released by the cell in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules—the  **first messengers**. (Intracellular signals, a non-local form or  [cell signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling "Cell signaling"), encompassing both first messengers and second messengers, are classified as  [juxtacrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juxtacrine_signalling "Juxtacrine signalling"),  [paracrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signaling "Paracrine signaling"), and  [endocrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system "Endocrine system")  depending on the range of the signal.) Second messengers trigger physiological changes such as  [proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_proliferation "Cell proliferation"),  [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation "Cellular differentiation"), migration, survival, and  [apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis "Apoptosis").

They are one of the triggers of intracellular  [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction "Signal transduction")  cascades.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger_system#cite_note-1)

Examples of second messenger molecules include  [cyclic AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate"),  [cyclic GMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate"),  [inositol trisphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate "Inositol trisphosphate"),  [diacylglycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacylglycerol "Diacylglycerol"), and  [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger_system#cite_note-2)  First messengers are extracellular factors, often  [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone "Hormone")  or  [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter"), such as  [epinephrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine "Epinephrine"),  [growth hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone "Growth hormone"), and  [serotonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin "Serotonin"). Because  [peptide hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone "Peptide hormone")  and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically  [hydrophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile "Hydrophile")molecules, these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly—unlike  [steroid hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone "Steroid hormone"), which usually do. This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers, so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly. An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger_system#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger_system#cite_note-4). For example, RasGTP signals link with the  [Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinase")  (MAPK) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as  [Myc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc "Myc")  and  [CREB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB "CREB").

### cAMP 
**Cyclic adenosine monophosphate** (**cAMP**, **cyclic AMP**, or **3',5'-cyclic**  [adenosine monophosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate "Adenosine monophosphate")) is a [second messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger "Second messenger")important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate") (ATP) and used for intracellular [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction "Signal transduction") in many different organisms, conveying the [cAMP-dependent pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMP-dependent_pathway "CAMP-dependent pathway"). It should not be confused with **5'-AMP**-activated protein kinase ([AMP-activated protein kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase "AMP-activated protein kinase")).

#### cAMP Cascade

The cAMP cascade is an intracellular  [signal transduction](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.de&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/neurowissenschaft/signaltransduktion/11823&xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259&usg=ALkJrhjPVrkrDNUFfBwq7uh-GwCG2LIyYQ)  system in which the incoming signal is additionally amplified.  The binding of a  [hormone](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.de&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/neurowissenschaft/hormone/5649&xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259&usg=ALkJrhh2TXErLD2uRA_zDUmRoFAYweVDgA)  to a cell receptor (  [receptors](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.de&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/neurowissenschaft/rezeptoren/11010&xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259&usg=ALkJrhhv8Poy7BFRgA0XxX0WDYLAZRLkAQ)  ) starts the cascade.  First, a  [G protein](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.de&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/neurowissenschaft/g-proteine/4923&xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259&usg=ALkJrhiUOPHzUEjm0Kszka84P0v6QjGD8w)  adjacent to the receptor is activated, which then binds a GTP (guanosine 5'-triphosphate) and cleaves its α subunit.  This process induces the formation of cAMP until the GTP is hydrolyzed.  The cAMP in turn activates protein kinase A, which catalyses another reaction.  Until the goal of the cascade is reached, two more reaction steps may be necessary.  The amplification of the signal is effected by each of the activated messengers inducing the next step until it is itself degraded or inactivated.  The cAMP cascade is ubiquitous, but can trigger different metabolic processes in different cells.

## Brain Regions

### Hippocampus
The  **hippocampus**  (from the  [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")  ἱππόκαμπος, "[seahorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse "Seahorse")" from ἵππος  _hippos_, "horse" and κάμπος  _kampos_, "sea-monster") is a major component of the  [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain")  of  [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human")  and other  [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrates "Vertebrates"). Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each  [side of the brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere "Cerebral hemisphere"). The hippocampus is part of the  [limbic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system "Limbic system"), and plays important roles in the  [consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation "Memory consolidation")  of information from  [short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory "Short-term memory")  to  [long-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory "Long-term memory"), and in  [spatial memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory "Spatial memory")  that enables navigation. The hippocampus is located under the  [cerebral cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex "Cerebral cortex")  in the  [allocortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocortex "Allocortex"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#cite_note-Martin2003-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#cite_note-Amaral2007-1a-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#cite_note-Amaral2007-1b-3)  and in  [primates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate "Primate")  it is in the  [medial temporal lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_temporal_lobe "Medial temporal lobe"). It contains two main interlocking parts: the  [hippocampus proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus_proper "Hippocampus proper")(also called Ammon's horn)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#cite_note-Pearce01-4)  and the  [dentate gyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus "Dentate gyrus").

In  [Alzheimer's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease "Alzheimer's disease")  (and other forms of  [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia "Dementia")), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage;  [short-term memory loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory "Short-term memory")  and  [disorientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorientation "Disorientation")  are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from  [oxygen starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical) "Hypoxia (medical)")  ([hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical) "Hypoxia (medical)")),  [encephalitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis "Encephalitis"), or  [medial temporal lobe epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_temporal_lobe_epilepsy "Medial temporal lobe epilepsy"). People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience  [anterograde amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia "Anterograde amnesia"): the inability to form and retain new  [memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory").

Since different  [neuronal cell types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body#Nervous_system "List of distinct cell types in the adult human body")  are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a  [model system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling")for studying  [neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology "Neurophysiology"). The form of  [neural plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity "Synaptic plasticity")  known as  [long-term potentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation "Long-term potentiation")  (LTP) was initially discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.

### Cerebellum
> Wikipedia - [Cerebellum][wiki:cerebellum]

The  **cerebellum**  (Latin for "little brain") is a major feature of the  [hindbrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindbrain "Hindbrain")  of all  [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate "Vertebrate"). Although usually smaller than the  [cerebrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum "Cerebrum"), in some animals such as the  [mormyrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormyrid "Mormyrid")  fishes it may be as large as or even larger.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-1)  In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in  [motor control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control "Motor control"). It may also be involved in some  [cognitive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition")  such as  [attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention "Attention")  and  [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language")  as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-2)  but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to  [coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination "Motor coordination"), precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from  [sensory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system "Sensory system")  of the  [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord "Spinal cord")  and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-Fine-3)  Cerebellar damage produces disorders in  [fine movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill "Fine motor skill"),  [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception "Equilibrioception"),  [posture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions "Human positions"), and  [motor learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning "Motor learning")  in humans.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-Fine-3)

Anatomically, the human cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the  [cerebral hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere "Cerebral hemisphere"). Its  [cortical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortex_(anatomy) "Cortex (anatomy)")  surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the  [cerebral cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex "Cerebral cortex"). These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an  [accordion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion "Accordion"). Within this thin layer are several types of  [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron")  with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being  [Purkinje cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell "Purkinje cell")  and  [granule cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum_granule_cell "Cerebellum granule cell"). This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small  [deep nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_cerebellar_nuclei "Deep cerebellar nuclei")  lying in the  [white matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter "White matter")interior of the cerebellum.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-Purves-4)

In addition to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of  [motor learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning "Motor learning"), most notably learning to adjust to changes in  [sensorimotor relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory-motor_coupling "Sensory-motor coupling"). Several theoretical models have been developed to explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of  [synaptic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity "Synaptic plasticity")  within the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by  [David Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist) "David Marr (neuroscientist)")  and  [James Albus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._Albus "James S. Albus"), based on the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the  [parallel fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_fiber "Parallel fiber")  of the granule cells; the other is an extremely strong input from a single  [climbing fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_fiber "Climbing fiber").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-Albus-5)  The basic concept of the  [Marr–Albus theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marr%E2%80%93Albus_theory "Marr–Albus theory")  is that the climbing fiber serves as a "teaching signal", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs. Observations of  [long-term depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_depression "Long-term depression")  in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#cite_note-6)

## Receptors
### CNR1
The **Cannabinoid receptor type 1**  (**CB1**), also known as  **cannabinoid receptor 1**, is a  [G protein-coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor "G protein-coupled receptor")  [cannabinoid receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor "Cannabinoid receptor")that in humans is encoded by the  _CNR1_  [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#cite_note-IUPHAR_CB1_Receptor-5)  The human CB1  receptor is  [expressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression "Gene expression")  in the  [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system "Peripheral nervous system")and  [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "Central nervous system").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#cite_note-IUPHAR_CB1_Receptor-5)  It is activated by:  [endocannabinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoids "Endocannabinoids"), a group of  [retrograde neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_signaling "Retrograde signaling")  that include  [anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide "Anandamide")  and  [2-arachidonoylglycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-arachidonoylglycerol "2-arachidonoylglycerol")  (2-AG); plant  [phytocannabinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytocannabinoid "Phytocannabinoid"), such as the compound  [THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol "Tetrahydrocannabinol")  which is an active ingredient of the  [psychoactive drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug "Psychoactive drug")  [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug) "Cannabis (drug)"); and,  [synthetic analogs of THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_cannabinoids "Synthetic cannabinoids"). CB1 is  [antagonized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist "Receptor antagonist")  by the phytocannabinoid  [tetrahydrocannabivarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabivarin "Tetrahydrocannabivarin")  (THCV).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#cite_note-7)

The primary  [endogenous agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_agonist "Endogenous agonist")  of the human CB1  receptor is  [anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide "Anandamide").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1#cite_note-IUPHAR_CB1_Receptor-5)
> Wikipedia - [G protein][wiki:GP]

### G protein-coupled receptor
**G protein-coupled receptors**  (**GPCRs**), also known as  **seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors**,  **7TM receptors**,  **heptahelical receptors**,  **serpentine receptor**, and  **G protein–linked receptors**  (**GPLR**), constitute a large  [protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family "Protein family")  of  [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor "Cell surface receptor")that detect  [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule")  outside the  [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)")  and activate internal  [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction "Signal transduction")  pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with  [G proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein "G protein"), they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the  [cell membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane")  seven times.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-trz-2)

G protein-coupled receptors are found only in  [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote"), including  [yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast "Yeast"),  [choanoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate "Choanoflagellate"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid12869759-3)  and animals. The  [ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry) "Ligand (biochemistry)")  that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds,  [odors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor "Odor"),  [pheromones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone "Pheromone"),  [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone "Hormone"), and  [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter"), and vary in size from small molecules to  [peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide "Peptide")  to large  [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"). G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases, and are also the target of approximately 34% of all modern medicinal drugs.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid17139284-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid29075003-6)

There are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors:

-   the  [cAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate")  signal pathway and
-   the  [phosphatidylinositol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol "Phosphatidylinositol")  signal pathway.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-Gilman_1987-7)

When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a  [guanine nucleotide exchange factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor "Guanine nucleotide exchange factor")  (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated  [G protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein "G protein")  by exchanging the  [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate "Guanosine diphosphate")  bound to the G protein for a  [GTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate "Guanosine triphosphate"). The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type ([Gαs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gs_alpha_subunit "Gs alpha subunit"),  [Gαi/o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi_alpha_subunit "Gi alpha subunit"),  [Gαq/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gq_alpha_subunit "Gq alpha subunit"),  [Gα12/13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G12/G13_alpha_subunits "G12/G13 alpha subunits")).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cite_note-Wettschureck_2005-8)

## Enzymes
### AC 
**Adenylyl cyclase**  ([EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number "Enzyme Commission number")  [4.6.1.1](https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/4.6.1.1), also commonly known as  **adenyl cyclase**  and  **adenylate cyclase**, abbreviated  **AC**) is an  [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme")with key regulatory roles in essentially all  [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase#cite_note-:0-2)  It is the most  [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly "Polyphyly")  known enzyme: six distinct classes have been described, all  [catalyzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis "Catalysis")  the same reaction but representing unrelated  [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene")  [families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family "Gene family")  with no known  [sequence or structural homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology "Sequence homology").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase#cite_note-:1-3)  The best known class of adenylyl cyclases is class III or AC-III (Roman numerals are used for classes). AC-III occurs widely in  [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote")  and has important roles in many human  [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase#cite_note-:2-4)

All classes of adenylyl cyclase  [catalyse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis "Catalysis")  the conversion of  [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate")  (ATP) to  [3',5'-cyclic AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate")  (cAMP) and  [pyrophosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate "Pyrophosphate").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase#cite_note-:2-4)  [Magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium "Magnesium")  [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion")  are generally required and appears to be closely involved in the enzymatic mechanism. The cAMP produced by AC then serves as a regulatory signal via specific cAMP-binding  [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"), either  [transcription factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor "Transcription factor"), enzymes (e.g., cAMP-dependent  [kinases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase "Kinase")), or ion  [transporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_proteins "Membrane transport proteins").

### PKA

In [cell biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology "Cell biology"), **protein kinase A** (**PKA**[[N 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A#cite_note-1)) is a family of [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme") whose activity is dependent on cellular levels of [cyclic AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_AMP "Cyclic AMP") (cAMP). PKA is also known as **cAMP-dependent protein kinase** ([EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number "Enzyme Commission number")  [2.7.11.11](https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.7.11.11)). Protein kinase A has several functions in the cell, including regulation of [glycogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen "Glycogen"), [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar "Sugar"), and [lipid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid "Lipid")  [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism").

## Proteins 
### G-Protein 

**G proteins**, also known as  **guanine nucleotide-binding proteins**, are a  [family of proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family "Protein family")  that act as  [molecular switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_switch "Molecular switch")  inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a  [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)")  to its interior. Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze  [guanosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate "Guanosine triphosphate")  (GTP) to  [guanosine diphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate "Guanosine diphosphate")  (GDP). When they are bound to GTP, they are 'on', and, when they are bound to GDP, they are 'off'. G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called  [GTPases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase "GTPase").

There are two classes of G proteins. The first function as  [monomeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomeric "Monomeric")  [small GTPases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_GTPase "Small GTPase")  (small G-proteins), while the second function as  [heterotrimeric G protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrimeric_G_protein "Heterotrimeric G protein")  [complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_complex "Protein complex"). The latter class of complexes is made up of  _[alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_alpha_subunit "G alpha subunit")_  (α),  _beta_  (β) and  _gamma_  (γ)  [subunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit "Protein subunit").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-Hurowitz_2000-1)  In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the  [beta-gamma complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_beta-gamma_complex "G beta-gamma complex")  [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-Clapham-2).

Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by  [G protein-coupled receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor "G protein-coupled receptor")  (GPCRs) that span the cell membrane.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-3)Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell, and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein. Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be "pre-coupled" with G proteins.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-Kou_Qin-4)  The G protein activates a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function. G protein-coupled receptor and G proteins working together transmit signals from many  [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone "Hormone"),  [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter"), and other signaling factors.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-Campbell-5)  G proteins regulate metabolic  [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme"),  [ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel "Ion channel"),  [transporter proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein "Membrane transport protein"), and other parts of the cell machinery, controlling  [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics) "Transcription (genetics)"),  [motility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility "Motility"),  [contractility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractility "Contractility"), and  [secretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion "Secretion"), which in turn regulate diverse systemic functions such as  [embryonic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_development "Embryonic development"), learning and memory, and  [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis "Homeostasis").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein#cite_note-pmid12040175-6)

### CREB
**CREB-TF**  (CREB,  **cAMP response element-binding protein**)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-ReferenceA-1)  is a cellular  [transcription factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor "Transcription factor"). It binds to certain  [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA")  sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE), thereby increasing or decreasing the  [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics) "Transcription (genetics)")  of the  [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-Purves-2)  CREB was first described in 1987 as a  [cAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate")-responsive transcription factor regulating the  [somatostatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin "Somatostatin")gene.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-3)

Genes whose transcription is regulated by CREB include:  _[c-fos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-fos "C-fos")_,  [BDNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDNF "BDNF"),  [tyrosine hydroxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase "Tyrosine hydroxylase"), numerous  [neuropeptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide "Neuropeptide")  (such as  [somatostatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin "Somatostatin"),  [enkephalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkephalin "Enkephalin"),  [VGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGF "VGF"),  [corticotropin-releasing hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone "Corticotropin-releasing hormone")),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-Purves-2)  and genes involved in the mammalian  [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock "Circadian clock")  ([PER1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER1 "PER1"),  [PER2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER2 "PER2")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-:0-4)

CREB is closely related in structure and function to  [CREM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMP_responsive_element_modulator "CAMP responsive element modulator")  ([cAMP response element modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMP_response_element_modulator "CAMP response element modulator")) and ATF-1 ([activating transcription factor-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activating_transcription_factor-1 "Activating transcription factor-1")) proteins. CREB proteins are expressed in many animals, including humans.

CREB has a well-documented role in  [neuronal plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity "Neuroplasticity")  and  [long-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory "Long-term memory")  formation in the brain and has been shown to be integral in the formation of  [spatial memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory "Spatial memory").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-5)  CREB downregulation is implicated in the pathology of  [Alzheimer's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease "Alzheimer's disease")  and increasing the expression of CREB is being considered as a possible therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB#cite_note-6)  CREB also has a role in  [photoentrainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(chronobiology) "Entrainment (chronobiology)")  in mammals.

**Adenylyl cyclase type 1**  is an  [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme")  that in humans is encoded by the  _ADCY1_  [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADCY1#cite_note-pmid8314585-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADCY1#cite_note-entrez-6). This gene encodes a form of adenylyl cyclase expressed in brain

*ADCY1* is a calmodulin-sensitive [adenylyl cyclase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase "Adenylyl cyclase"). In terms of function, It may be involved in regulatory processes in the central nervous system; specifically, it may play a role in memory acquisition and learning. It is inhibited by the [G protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein "G protein")beta and gamma subunit complex.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADCY1#cite_note-genecards-7)
> Wikipedia - [ADCY1][wiki:ADCY1]

This gene encodes a member of the of adenylate cyclase gene family that is primarily expressed in the brain. This protein is regulated by calcium/calmodulin concentration and may be involved in brain development. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. 

ADCY1 (Adenylate Cyclase 1) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with ADCY1 include [Deafness, Autosomal Recessive 44](http://www.malacards.org/card/deafness_autosomal_recessive_44 "See Deafness, Autosomal Recessive 44 at Malacards") and [Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Sensorineural Deafness Type Dfnb](http://www.malacards.org/card/autosomal_recessive_non_syndromic_sensorineural_deafness_type_dfnb "See Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Sensorineural Deafness Type Dfnb at Malacards").

## Signaling Pathways

### Cannabinoid receptor signaling (homo sapiens)

[![cannabinoid receptor signaling][cannabinoid-path]][cannabinoid-path-link]

The  **endocannabinoid system**  (**ECS**) is a biological system composed of endocannabinoids, which are  [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous "Endogenous")  [lipid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid "Lipid")-based  [retrograde neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_neurotransmission "Retrograde neurotransmission")  that bind to  [cannabinoid receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptors "Cannabinoid receptors"), and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the vertebrate  [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "Central nervous system")  (including the  [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain")) and  [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system "Peripheral nervous system"). The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and  [cognitive processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_process "Cognitive process")  including  [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility "Fertility"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-1)  [pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy "Pregnancy"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-2)during  [pre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development "Prenatal development")- and  [postnatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_period "Postpartum period")  development,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-3)  [appetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite "Appetite"),  [pain-sensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception "Nociception"),  [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology) "Mood (psychology)"), and  [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), and in mediating the  [pharmacological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacological "Pharmacological")  effects of  [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug) "Cannabis (drug)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-5)  The ECS is also involved in mediating some of the physiological and cognitive effects of voluntary  [physical exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise "Physical exercise")  in humans and other animals, such as contributing to exercise-induced  [euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria "Euphoria")  as well as modulating  [locomotor activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotor_activity "Locomotor activity")  and  [motivational salience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_salience "Motivational salience")  for  [rewards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system "Reward system").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-endocannabinoids-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-Primary-Runner's_high_definition-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-9)  In humans, the  [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma "Blood plasma")  concentration of certain endocannabinoids (i.e.,  [anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide "Anandamide")) have been found to rise during physical activity;[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-endocannabinoids-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-Primary-Runner's_high_definition-7)  since endocannabinoids can effectively penetrate the  [blood–brain barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier "Blood–brain barrier"), it has been suggested that anandamide, along with other  [euphoriant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoriant "Euphoriant")  neurochemicals, contributes to the development of exercise-induced euphoria in humans, a state colloquially referred to as a  [runner's high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#Euphoria "Neurobiological effects of physical exercise").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-endocannabinoids-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-Primary-Runner's_high_definition-7)

Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CB1, first cloned in 1990; and CB2, cloned in 1993. CB1 receptors are found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid  [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry) "Ligand (biochemistry)")  (binding molecule),  [anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide "Anandamide"), as well as its  [mimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic "Mimetic")  phytocannabinoid,  [THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol "Tetrahydrocannabinol"). One other main endocannabinoid is  [2-arachidonoylglycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-arachidonoylglycerol "2-arachidonoylglycerol")  (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid,  [CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol "Cannabidiol"). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-Grotenhermen2012-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-NatureCB1-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system#cite_note-Russo2011-12)

### Dopamine Metabolism
[![dopamine metabolism][dopamine-path]][dopamine-path-link]
Dopamine (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and [phenethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine "Phenethylamine") families. It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter, and plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an [amine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine "Amine") synthesized by removing a [carboxyl group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyl_group "Carboxyl group") from a molecule of its [precursor chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry) "Precursor (chemistry)")  [L-DOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA "L-DOPA"), which is [synthesized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis "Biosynthesis") in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain"), dopamine functions as a [neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter")—a chemical released by [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct [dopamine pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_pathway "Dopaminergic pathway"), one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of [reward-motivated behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system "Reward system"). The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#cite_note-Dissecting_components_of_reward:_%E2%80%98liking%E2%80%99,_%E2%80%98wanting%E2%80%99,_and_learning-2)[_[not in citation given](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_] and many [addictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction "Addiction")  [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug "Psychoactive drug") increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in [motor control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_system "Motor system") and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and [cell groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_cell_groups "Dopaminergic cell groups") form a dopamine system which is [neuromodulatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation "Neuromodulation").
