This article is part of the post [Consequencs of Chronic Cannabis Abuse --- Increased Risk of Developing Drug-Induced Psychotic Disorders in Patients with ADHD --- A Neuro-Biological Primer](https://oxytocin.home.blog/2019/06/27/consequences-of-chronic-drug-abuse/) that turned out too extensive for one title. 

The title reads "drugs" because I make LSD responsible for some of my symptoms, the study, however, only refers to cannabis and shows that ADHD in combination with chronic cannabis abuse does in "fact" increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other disorders.

I'm not a neuro-biologist. This article doesn't mean to add any scientific value. Please do **not** cite anything or take its plausibility/correctness for granted. This is just a hobby and part of therapy in terms of fun activity.

## Abstract
Due to their impulsive behaviour, a lot of people with ADHD tend to misuse substances like cannabis --- Does chronic cannabis consume and ADHD affect the risk of developing psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia? --- A small meta-analysis.

# Increased Risk of Developing Drug-Induced Psychotic Disorders in Patients with ADHD
## Preface
With over 24 million users, cannabis is the most widely used drug in the USA; a seemingly harmless substance if you smoke a joint in the morning - abuse, however should not be underestimated as it may have long term consequences.

## ADHD
[ADHD] often correlates with substance abuse.<sup>[</sup>[^adhd-substance-misuse]<sup>]</sup> People who suffer from ADHD should be extra cautious dealing with drugs. Increased risk of addiction<sup>[</sup>[^adhd-substance-misuse-2]<sup>]</sup> and high prevalance<sup>[</sup>[^adhd-prevalance]<sup>]</sup> of comorbid disorders carry a high risk of developing psychotic and personality disorders.

> Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are known to be at significantly greater risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUD) compared to peers. Impulsivity, which could lead to higher levels of drug use, is a known symptom of ADHD and likely accounts, in part, for this relationship.

> To examine the 12-month prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity of ADHD in a collective of adult psychiatric patients admitted to an open general ward in a psychiatric hospital in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) over a period of one year

> The 12-month prevalence of ADHD was 59.0 % (severe symptomatology: 33.1 %), high rates of comorbid disorders (92.9 % depression, 5.1 % bipolar disorder, 28.6 % anxiety disorder, 30.6 % emotional unstable (Borderline) personality disorder, 31.6 % avoidant personality disorder, 18.4 % dependent personality disorder, 25.5 % combined personality disorder, 10.2 % obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, 26.5 % PTSD, 25.5 % restless legs syndrome, 24.5 % adiposity, 11.2 % eating disorder, 45.9 % learning difficulty, 51.0 % ni cotine dependency, 4.1 % alcohol dependency, 7.1 % illegal substance dependency), risk factors for ADHD, a high genetic risk (72.4 %) and problems in psychosocial functioning.

## Psychoses
Frequent long-term abuse of potent cannabis can cause psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective.
<sup>[</sup>[^cannabis-psychosis-risk-factor]<sup>, </sup>[^cannabis-schizo-evidence]<sup>, </sup>[^cannabis-schizo-risk-value]<sup>]</sup>
 
> Cannabis is a known risk factor for schizophrenia, although the exact neurobiological process through which the effects on psychosis occur is not well-understood.

> Cannabis is involved in approximately 50% of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophreniform psychosis cases.<sup>[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/#ref1),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/#ref2),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/#ref3),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/#ref4),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/#ref5)]</sup>

## Conclusion.
Long term cannabis use favors development of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia<sup>[</sup>[^cannabis-psychosis-risk-factor]<sup>, </sup>[^cannabis-schizo-evidence]<sup>, </sup>[^cannabis-schizo-risk-value]<sup>]</sup> as it directly stimulates the mesolimbic system,<sup>[</sup>[^cannabis-effects-thc]<sup>]</sup> which leads to a constant excess of dopamine<sup>[</sup>[^cannabis-dopamine]<sup>]</sup>. In combination with the underlying dopmine deficiency<sup>[</sup>[^adhd-sugar]<sup>]</sup> in persons with ADHD,<sup>[</sup>[^adhd-dopa]<sup>]</sup> this leads to a much higher risk of developing drug induced psychoses such as schizophrenia, due to the chronic imbalance of dopamine levels between the mesolimbic system and prefrontal cortex - as postulated by the dopamine hypothesis.<sup>[</sup>[^schizo-role-dopamine]<sup>]</sup>

> Cannabis use doubles the risk of developing psychosis in vulnerable people. There even exists a relationship regarding the dose used and the age of first use.

> *In vivo* microdialysis shows that acute THC increases dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5123717/#R41), striatum [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5123717/#R42) and nucleus accumbens

> Increases in mesolimbic dopamine transmission are observed when animals are treated with all known drugs of abuse, including cannabis
> -- [A Brain on Cannabinoids: The Role of Dopamine Release in Reward Seeking]

> The revised dopamine hypothesis states that dopamine abnormalities in the mesolimbic and prefrontal brain regions exist in schizophrenia.

> DA hypothesis proposed that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are due to an excess of DA signaling in the striatal and/or mesolimbic areas of the brain[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635536/#R3). In contrast, negative symptoms are thought to be related to deficits in prefrontal cortical DA signaling, likely through D1receptors[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635536/#R4),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635536/#R5)

> Dysfunction of dopaminergic system is implicated in many neuropsychological diseases, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
> -- [Role of dopamine receptors in ADHD: a systematic meta-analysis]

> The observation that ADHD represents a dopamine-deficient state could explain why treatments that increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, improve symptoms, at least acutely.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3598008/#R3) However, based on the increasing evidence for D2 receptor desensitization/downregulation as a mechanism underlying ADHD, one might expect these drugs to have an enhanced potential to cause addiction
